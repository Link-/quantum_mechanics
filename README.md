# Quantum Mechanics
This a curated list of Physics related videos that aim to clarify complex concepts of Quantum Mechanics with visualizations that are easy to grasp by non-Physicists. Basic understanding of Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability, and Complex Analysis is very helpful, yet not necessary.

This list assumes you have a very basic understanding of the concepts associated with Quantum Mechanics.

These videos have been sorted to maximize your comprehension rate as some of these items have other videos as implicit pre-requisites.
